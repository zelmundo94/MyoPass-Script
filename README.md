MyoPass-Script
==============

Script to enter password into browsers using KeePass technology.

The script is coded to a gestural recognition bracelet called the
Myo Band. We have used the script to modify the gestures needed to
enter the passwords and other necessary information for entry fields. The intention of this
hack was to assist disabled individuals using the computer. Please fork if you would like to 
help those who may be handicap when using a hands-on technological device.
